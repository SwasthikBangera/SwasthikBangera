### Hello, World!

I'm <b>Swasthik Bangera</b>, a self-taught machine learning engineer with background in Simulation, Manufacturing and Quality. My passion is to use my mathematical, statistical, and analytical skills to find solutions to complex real-world problems and create a smarter, easier way to navigate and comprehend the world during our time here. I also enjoy Beatles, Reading, Soccer or Football (depending on what part of tribe you are on), Formula1 & Tennis.
